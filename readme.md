<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Screenshot][screenshot]]()

The original BallDroppings project was really fun, but  the original developer no longer owns the domain to their website, and the javascript version of BallDroppings relied on the now obsolete Adobe FLash. This was created to replace both the javascript and windows versions of the original project.
